## Project 1
Project 1 is split into two options. You may choose to do either Project 1a or
Project 1b.
- **Project 1a**: a quiz game!
- **Project 1b**: your own custom game!

## Project 1a: Quiz Game
We've provided a test file that expects your quiz program to behave in a
certain way and it will test your program for errors. This is test-driven
development!

Read more about [Project 1a Specifications](1a-quiz-game.md).

## Project 1b: Custom Game
If you choose not to do the quiz, then you can build whatever you want!

Read more about [Project 1b Specifications](1b-custom-game.md).

## Project Feedback + Evaluation
Both Project 1a and Project 1b will be graded on the same rubric. 

#### Scoring
| Score | Expectations |
| ----- | ------------ |
| **0** | _Incomplete._ |
| **1** | _Does not meet expectations._ |
| **2** | _Meets expectations, good job!_ |
| **3** | _Exceeds expectations, you wonderful creature, you!_ |


#### Evaluation
* __Project Workflow__: Did you complete the user stories, wireframes, task tracking, and/or ERDs, as specified above? Did you use source control as expected for the phase of the program youâ€™re in (detailed above)?

* __Technical Requirements__: Did you deliver a project that met all the technical requirements? Given what the class has covered so far, did you build something that was reasonably complex?

* __Creativity__: Did you add a personal spin or creative element into your project submission? Did you deliver something of value to the end user (not just a login button and an index page)?

* __Code Quality__: Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class, such as spacing, modularity, and semantic naming? Did you comment your code as your instructors have in class?

* __Deployment__: Did you deploy your application to a public url using GitHub Pages?

* __Total__: Your instructors will give you a total score on your project between:

#### Stylistic Requirements:
* HTML & CSS
  * good indentation
  * sensible id, class names
  * no redundancy. Redundant styles are extracted as classes
  * display messages in HTML, not using `alert()`

* JavaScript
  * no syntax errors
  * good indentation
  * properly commented code
  * good variable names
  * minimal global variables
  * functions have good scope (variables aren't declared outside functions)
  * functions use parameters
  * functions are used to reduce redundancy
  * handles DOM loading without problems
  * DOM manipulation (jQuery or vanilla javascript)

This will serve as a helpful overall gauge of whether you met the project
goals, but __the more important scores are the individual ones__ above, which
can help you identify where to focus your efforts for the next project!
